    <h2>Why was Hao's Signature built</h2>
    <p>In th eearly 1980s, Hao and his brother,both immigrants from Italy found themselves in a small quite town called johor bahru. For them who where raised in Italy ,where food was more than just sustences but to bring family and friends together. With that passion in mind both brother created their first restaurant called Hao's Signature. </p>

    <p>Before having this sucessful restaurant known today, both brothers worked day and night in various kitchens across the country to hone their skill. Kitchen to kitchen, local restaurants to restaurant for years.</p>

   <p>
 At first, business was slow. But Hao and his brother's dedication to quality food, warmth, and hospitality slowly began to pay off. Word of mouth spread, and soon, "Hao's Signature" had a loyal following. What made the restaurant unique wasn’t just the food—it was the atmosphere. The restaurant became a gathering place where people celebrated life’s small moments: birthdays, anniversaries, or simply a good meal with friends.
    
 Hao would often greet regulars with a hug and a joke, while his brother, in the open kitchen, would sing along to Italian opera while crafting his famous risotto. The two brother's warmth and love for food resonated with everyone who visited.
